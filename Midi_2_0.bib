	url = {https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/62802},
	shorttitle = {{MIDI} Polyphonic Expression},
	abstract = {This paper is about {MIDI} Polyphonic Expression controllers. Since the invention of the synthesizer and computer music instruments a decoupling between performers and sound generators has occurred. Expression has in some ways been lost and the need for performers to physically interact with instruments has not been fulfilled by the proliferation of {MIDI} keyboards and controllers. Computer music can feel sterile and less expressive than music played with acoustic instruments. The inability of musical controllers to capture expressive gestures makes performing emotionally engaging electronic music difficult for instrumentalists. By looking at the history behind {MIDI} and {MPE} and discussing the human need for expression in music, the author gives a framework for an experiment he conducts. By testing several {MPE} controllers in a systematic way he hopes to answer questions over {MIDI} Polyphonic Expression’s role in restoring tactility and gestural expression to musical instruments.},

	abstract = {Michel Waisvisz's The Hands is one of the most famous and long-lasting research projects in the literature of digital music instruments. Consisting of a pair of data gloves and exhibited for the first time in 1984, The Hands is a pioneering work in digital devices for performing live music. It is a work that engaged Waisvisz for almost a quarter of a century and, in turn, has inspired many generations of music technologists and performers of live music. Despite being often cited in the relevant literature, however, the documentation concerning the sensor architecture, design, mapping strategies, and development of these data gloves is sparse. In this article, we aim to fill this gap by offering a detailed history behind the development of The Hands. The information contained in this article was retrieved and collated by searching the {STEIM} archive, interviewing close collaborators of Waisvisz, and browsing through the paper documentation found in his personal folders and office.},
