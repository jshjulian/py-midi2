# A Review of MIDI Polyphonic Expression: A Bridge Between Acoustic

In this paper, Mads Bye looks at the history of MIDI and MPE, discusses the human need for expression in music, and conducts an experiment testing the expressivity, control, and other metrics of various MPE controllers.

Bye looks at MIDI and MPE from the perspective of a performer, being an accomplished guitarist and familiar with MIDI controllers and sequencer software. The focus of the paper is discussing the gap between the performer and the sound source of their instrument (disjunction). This gap is very smaall for acoustic instruments where for an instrument like a violin or guitar, the performer touches the string which makes the sound. A perfomrer playing the piano is slightly removed since they press a key which then activates a hammer that hits a string, but this action is still one-to-one. For electronic music instruments, the sound source can be much further away from the performer since a key press could result in some generative algorithm that doesn't even create the same sound if the same action is made. For electronic instruments that are intended to give more expressivitiy to the performer, Bye argues that the MIDI protocol, while it allows perfomers and developers to create electronic music in an easy affordable way, has limitiations that limit the expressivity of devices created that use the protocol.

Bye reviews the history of MIDI by starting with early synthesizers that used CV and Gate outputs. Since these synthesizers had no common standard, it was difficult for synths made by different manufacturers to communicate with each other, and so MIDI was born. Many new possibilities opened up with the new specification and many of these possibilities came from the accessibility and universality of MIDI which came from concessions on functionality and technical limitations. Some limitations detailed in the paper include information being limited to 7 bits, serial signal path adds latency, and temporal smearing which is delay that could alter attack times and timbre of sound. The paper also mentions some alternatives created to address MIDI's limiations including ZIPI and OSC.

Bye wants the reader to think differently about music controllers and talks about some controllers in a non-keyboard style including the Electronic Wind Instrument by Nyle Steiner and GM-70 from Roland. Bye also reviews some music controllers that utilize MIDI in different ways including a Wii remote that sends MIDI information as well as the reacTable that sends MIDI information based on objects placed on the table.

Bye then argues the need for MPE for performers. The idea of disjunction is reintroduced where the keyboard creates disjunction between the control mechanism and the sound source, and modifying a sound after its been played is not very easy in MIDI. Bye goes into more detail about the limitations of MIDI including no per note expression.

In the final section of the paper, Bye details an experiment to test the playability, performability, musical control, degrees of freedom, feedback modalities, configuration/mappings flexibility, and required expertise of 5 MPE controllers. Bye acknowledges the subjectivity of this experiment, but goes into depth about his experience with all of the controllers. Bye found that the musical control of all the MPE controllers was high since the timbre of the instrument could be controlled with all of the MPE controllers. He notes the lack of haptic feedback as one would get on an acoustic instrument. In the final statement of the paper, Bye concludes that the MPE controllers give a much higher degree of expression than a standard MIDI keyboard and MPE controllers do mitigate disjunction and to a certain degree bridge the gap between acoustic and electronic instruments.
