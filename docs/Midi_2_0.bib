	abstract = {This paper is about {MIDI} Polyphonic Expression controllers. Since the invention of the synthesizer and computer music instruments a decoupling between performers and sound generators has occurred. Expression has in some ways been lost and the need for performers to physically interact with instruments has not been fulfilled by the proliferation of {MIDI} keyboards and controllers. Computer music can feel sterile and less expressive than music played with acoustic instruments. The inability of musical controllers to capture expressive gestures makes performing emotionally engaging electronic music difficult for instrumentalists. By looking at the history behind {MIDI} and {MPE} and discussing the human need for expression in music, the author gives a framework for an experiment he conducts. By testing several {MPE} controllers in a systematic way he hopes to answer questions over {MIDI} Polyphonic Expression’s role in restoring tactility and gestural expression to musical instruments.},

Consisting of a pair of data gloves and exhibited for the first time in 1984, The Hands is a pioneering work in digital devices for performing live music. It is a work that engaged Waisvisz for almost a quarter of a century and, in turn, has inspired many generations of music technologists and performers of live music. Despite being often cited in the relevant literature, however, the documentation concerning the sensor architecture, design, mapping strategies, and development of these data gloves is sparse. In this article, we aim to fill this gap by offering a detailed history behind the development of The Hands. The information contained in this article was retrieved and collated by searching the {STEIM} archive, interviewing close collaborators of Waisvisz, and browsing through the paper documentation found in his personal folders and office.},

	abstract = {{MIDI} (; Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that describes a communications protocol, digital interface, and electrical connectors that connect a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers, and related audio devices for playing, editing, and recording music.  The specification originates in the paper Universal Synthesizer Interface published by Dave Smith and Chet Wood of Sequential Circuits at the 1981 Audio Engineering Society conference in New York City.A single {MIDI} cable can carry up to sixteen channels of {MIDI} data, each of which can be routed to a separate device. Each interaction with a key, button, knob or slider is converted into a {MIDI} event, which specifies musical instructions, such as a note's pitch, timing and loudness. One common {MIDI} application is to play a {MIDI} keyboard or other controller and use it to trigger a digital sound module (which contains synthesized musical sounds) to generate sounds, which the audience hears produced by a keyboard amplifier. {MIDI} data can be transferred via {MIDI} or {USB} cable, or recorded to a sequencer or digital audio workstation to be edited or played back.A file format that stores and exchanges the data is also defined. Advantages of {MIDI} include small file size, ease of modification and manipulation and a wide choice of electronic instruments and synthesizer or digitally sampled sounds.: 4   A {MIDI} recording of a performance on a keyboard could sound like a piano or other keyboard instrument; however, since {MIDI} records the messages and information about their notes and not the specific sounds, this recording could be changed to many other sounds, ranging from synthesized or sampled guitar or flute to full orchestra.
Before the development of {MIDI}, electronic musical instruments from different manufacturers could generally not communicate with each other. This meant that a musician could not, for example, plug a Roland keyboard into a Yamaha synthesizer module. With {MIDI}, any {MIDI}-compatible keyboard (or other controller device) can be connected to any other {MIDI}-compatible sequencer, sound module, drum machine, synthesizer, or computer, even if they are made by different manufacturers.
{MIDI} technology was standardized in 1983 by a panel of music industry representatives, and is maintained by the {MIDI} Manufacturers Association ({MMA}). All official {MIDI} standards are jointly developed and published by the {MMA} in Los Angeles, and the {MIDI} Committee of the Association of Musical Electronics Industry ({AMEI}) in Tokyo. In 2016, the {MMA} established The {MIDI} Association ({TMA}) to support a global community of people who work, play, or create with {MIDI}.},
